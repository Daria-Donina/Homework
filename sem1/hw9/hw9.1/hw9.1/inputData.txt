i never told you what i do for a living
stay out of the light
or the photograph that i gave you
you can say a prayer if you need to
or just get in line and i'll grieve you
can i meet you alone
another night and i'll see you
another night and i'll be you
some other way to continue
to hide my face
another knife in my hands
a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me of
i'm so dirty babe
the kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
i keep a book of the names and those
only go so far 'til you bury them
so deep and down we go
touched by angel though
i fall out of grace
i did it all so maybe I'd live this every day
another knife in my hands
a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me off
i'm so dirty babe
it ain't the money
and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
it's for the bodies I claim and lose
only go so far 'til you bury them
so deep and down we go
down
and down we go
and down we go
and down we go
and we all fall down
i tried
i tried
and we'll all dance along to the tune of your death
we'll love again
we'll laugh again
and it's better off this way
and never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head
and we're all dead now
well never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head
and we're all dead now
Well i tried
one more night
one more night
well i'm laughin' out cryin' out laughin' out loud
i tried well I tried well i tried
'Cause i tried but i lied
i lied
i tried
i tried
i tried well
and we'll love again
we'll laugh again
we'll cry again
and we'll dance again
and it's better off this way so much better off this way
i can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed
and never again and never again
they gave us two shots to the back of the head
and we're all dead now
